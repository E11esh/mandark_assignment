<h1>This repository contains solution to five problems </h1>
  <h2>1</h2>
  <p>Accept two positive integers start and end as input. Construct the following sets:
1. A is the set of positive integers from start to end (endpoints inclusive) divisible by 3.
2. B is the set of positive integers from start to end (endpoints inclusive) divisible by 5.
Find the set of all integers that are:
● divisible by 3 or 5, and store it in the variable o1
● divisible by both 3 and 5, and store it in the variable o2
● divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5, and store it in the variable o3
● divisible by 5 but not divisible by 3, and store it in the variable o4
Note that each bullet corresponds to a separate set. You have to accept start and end as input
and create these four sets. You do not have to print the output to the console.

<p>Write a program to read all IP addresses (binary format) before termination line END from
ipaddress.txt file and after converting into decimal format , print the output in following format.</p>
  
<h2>5</h2>
<p>
  The below image represents a grid having 11x11 nodes numbered from 0 to 10.
● Distance between one node to the next connected node is 1 unit.
● One can go in any direction, each letter counts as 1 unit in each direction.
● N North
● S South
● E East
● W West
The below graph shows the path of “NNNNEEENE” starting from (0,0)
  Write a program to take a string as input from the user and print the total distance travelled.
Test Case:
1. Input Expected Output
   NNNNEEENE    9
2. Input    Expected Output
   NEWS        4
